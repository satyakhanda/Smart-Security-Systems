# Smart Security Systems

**Description**
Large businesses are producing an extraordinary amount of untagged security footage every day. It’s hard to store in a format that can be queried on-demand in a way that scales as the amount of the security footage archive grows. With valuable features like the ability to detect location and time, the video intelligence API converts raw video into metadata. This metadata is pulled into the yuuvis® database using the yuuvis® API and is stored in a much more time, space and cost-efficient manner than storing complete video footage. Using yuuvis®, one can easily perform queries to obtain the exact snippet of metadata (and thus the associated video) based on various tags and filters using the Elasticsearch functionality.
